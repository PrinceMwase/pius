                        <h5>Our Mission / History</h5>
                        <blockquote>St Pius X Catholic Parish began only as an outstation church of St Montfort(CI) up until in August of 1965 was consecrated to become a parish.The birth of the church was a result of some local people living down the hills of Soche, Zingwangwa, Chilobwe and Nkolokosa areas who were gathering to pray in cutting the distance that was between their homes and St. Montfort Parish.The Parish was blesssed by the Archbishop of the Blantyre Archdiocese, Jaannes Theusinissen.With that small beginning with few parishioners the church at St Pius started growing.One thing that stands out with a difference for St Pius Parish with other parishes is that while most of the parishes were first served by white missionaries, it was served from the beginning by diocesian local priests.This was in part a sign of the desire for African churches to start weaning themselves off from the dependence on Rome.The increasing population of christians also led to the birth of an outstation of St Peter and Paul in 1978.Now there are 31 outstations at St Pius Catholic Parish. From 1963 up to now (2021 ) the parish has been served by 24 parish priests and 8 Curates.As a model parish its mission is to seek to fulfill all the pillars of the catholic church by following what it teaches. This is done through providing care and the Sacraments to its christians.St Pius X Parish is self-reliant, all christians are a family who worship together as they thank God in various ways(such as singing songs and other activities that are done).Following Christian education under the catholic church with the inspiration of St Pope Pius X, we want to fulfill the work that Jesus Christ started by bringing peace in our homes,our areas,our Archdiocese and the whole world. As a people led by the Holy Spirit we strive to follow the life of Jesus Christ by preaching the word of God </blockquote>
